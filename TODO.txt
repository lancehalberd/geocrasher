Gems are added to inventory like maps and can be consumed at will, but new ones won't spawn until they are used.

Void Beacons can be placed to prevent anything from being spawned in an area. Can be reclaimed and redeployed at a cost.

A way point is created at your initial location. Additional way points can be added at certain distances from your starting way point.
